We are happy to announce that the second version of the tool new/s/leak has been completed. New/s/leak supports journalists in the evaluation of very large volumes of documents, such as those that repeatedly emerge from leaks of internal company or government data. The approach of the open-source software is the automatic identification of proper names as well as their visualization and filtering along relationship networks in the documents. In this way, one can quickly gain insight into otherwise unmanageable amounts of data and find starting points for journalistic reporting. 

During the second project phase, financed by the Volkswagen Foundation, the software was optimized for fast processing of new document collections and numerous file formats. In addition, new/s/leak now supports more than 40 languages. 

A third project phase to support Open Government Data is planned for next year. Together with SPIEGEL, HITeC e.V. and the Transparenzparenzportal Hamburg, funds were successfully raised in the funding line "Calls for Transfer" from the city of Hamburg.

More information, installation instructions and a software demonstration can be found on this website.
