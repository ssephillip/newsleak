# Add new content

Run in the `documentation` directory (with hugo binary installed):

```
hugo new news/my-new-blogpost.md
```

Then edit the content of `news/my-new-blogpost.md`.

Add the newly added file(s) to the repository and commit the changes.

Finally, run:

```
./publish_to_gh-pages.sh
```

to publish the changes to the gh-pages branch of this repository. 

Push the updated branch to the remote host.

```
cd newsleak.io
git push
```

The static content generated by hugo in the `newsleak.io` directory will be automatically published into `gh-pages` branch. Github.io serves the content under the CNAME newsleak.io
