/**
 * Provides functionality to measure the time spent on different parts of the application (measurment targets).
 * Additionally it provides functionality to write these measurements (and other useful information) to a text file.
 *
 * The StatsService works as follows:
 * To begin a time measurement a start-event needs to be registered at the StatsService.
 * To stop a time measurement an end-event needs to be registered.
 *
 * To register an event the method {@link #addStatsEvent(String, String)} is called.
 * As parameters, the event type constant ({@link #EVENT_TYPE_START} or {@link #EVENT_TYPE_STOP}), the constant of that corresponds to the measurement target and the current {@link Instant} is passed.
 *
 * To add a new measurement target (i.e. measure a part of the software that is currently not measured), a new measurement target CONSTANT should be defined in this class.
 *
 *
 *
 * Additional information on how this Service works:
 * Before the time measurements can be written to a file, a new run needs to be started.
 * Measurement events can be registered <b>BEFORE</b> a run was started.
 * Starting a new run simply sets the values that are needed to write the stats to a file.
 * This information is not passed as parameter of the method that writes the stats to the file, because the required information might not be available when that method is called.
 *
 *
 * When a start-event is registered multiple times for the same measurement target, all but the first start-event are ignored.
 * When an end-event is registered multiple times only the last end-event that was registered is used to determine the time spent on the measurement target.
 * This is done to enable measurement of Analysis Components (e.g. {@link uhh_lt.newsleak.annotator.KeytermExtractor}, {@link uhh_lt.newsleak.writer.PostgresDbWriter}).
 *
 * The reason behind this is the following:
 * There is no method that provides (reliable) information if an Analysis Component processed all documents.
 * There are some methods that seem as they could be used for this purpose, but it has been shown that they do not work reliably.
 * However, when processing a document, an Analysis Component always calls the method "process" ({@link org.apache.uima.analysis_component.AnalysisComponent#process(AbstractCas)}).
 * Consequentially, when an Analysis Component processes the first document and the last document it calls the method "process".
 * Thus, we can register the start-event at the beginning of the method "process" and the end-event at the end of the method "process".
 * The problem with this is that the method "process" is called many times in between the first and the last time it is called.
 * This is why the start-event and end-event are handled as described above.
 * This works very efficiently, because the events are stored in hash maps.
